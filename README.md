# 30DaysOfKotlin
This is my work on 30 Days of Kotlin with Google Developers, an initiative to improve understanding of Kotlin and apply it in real projects using Google resources (codelabs, sessions with Googlers).

**<<< This Repository contains an Android Project with 2 Modules >>>**

- **app Module:** Containing an Android Application built using Kotlin as Programming Language.
- **kotlin Module:** Containing the individual Kotlin Files to Understand & experiment with the Language features itself.
